**waking time** is a calculator that helps you find the best time to wake up.

## What we know

It takes the average human 14 minutes to fall asleep; a sleep cycle typically lasts 90 minutes; a good night's sleep consists of 5 or 6 complete sleep cycles. Waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle leaves you feeling tired and groggy, but waking up in between cycles lets you wake up feeling refreshed and alert!

### About the project
